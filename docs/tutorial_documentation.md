# How to Contribute to the Documentation

Documentation is the lifeline of our Rover. Whether you are working on the robotic arm, the drone, or the science mission, documenting your work allows the team to grow and prevents knowledge loss.

This guide will walk you through setting up your computer to write, preview, and publish documentation using **Zensical** and **GitHub**.

## 1. Prerequisites & Installation

Before writing, you need to set up your "Development Environment". You only need to do this once.

### Step A: Install the Tools
1.  **VS Code**: Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This is the editor we use.
2.  **Git**: Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
    *   *Windows users:* Select "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" during installation.
3.  **Python**: MkDocs runs on Python. Download [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    *   !!! warning "Important for Windows"
        During installation, make sure to check the box **"Add Python to PATH"** at the bottom of the installer window.

### Step B: VS Code Setup
Open VS Code and install these recommended extensions (click the square icon on the left sidebar):
*   **Markdown All in One** (by Yu Zhang) - Helps with shortcuts and table of contents.
*   **Code Spell Checker** (by Street Side Software) - Typos are unprofessional!
*   **GitHub Pull Requests** - Makes syncing easier.
